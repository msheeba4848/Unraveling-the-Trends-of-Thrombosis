## Introduction
This repository showcases a visual storytelling project based on a medical dataset from Chiba University Hospital [1]. Thrombosis, a severe consequence of collagen illnesses, is analyzed through various visualizations to uncover insights into its relationship with biomarkers, demographics, and other factors.

The goal is to present data in a compelling, insightful, and aesthetically pleasing way, leveraging consistent themes and a thoughtful color palette to communicate complex findings effectively.

## Data Overview
The dataset consists of multiple CSV files with information on:
- **Patient Info**: Demographics and hospital visits.
- **Examination Results**: Collagen-related test results.
- **Symptoms**: Symptoms during diagnostic tests.
- **Diagnosis**: Diagnosed collagen diseases.
- **ANA Patterns**: Test patterns aiding autoimmune diagnoses.

## Key Questions Explored

### 1. Biomarkers and Diagnoses
- **Insight**: Anti-Cardiolipin antibody concentrations (IgG) were higher in severe thrombosis cases, but no definitive biomarkers were identified.
- **Visualization**: Bar plots with a focused color gradient to highlight concentration differences.

### 2. Gender and Collagen Diseases
- **Insight**: Females were admitted more frequently than males, showing unique symptoms like thrombophlebitis and abortion. However, no gender-specific predictors were identified.
- **Visualization**: Count plots with gender-specific colors and proportional bar charts.

### 3. Diagnosis and Thrombosis
- **Insight**: Diseases like Lupus and Antiphospholipid Syndrome were common among thrombosis patients. Statistical tests showed no direct dependency between diagnosis and thrombosis.
- **Visualization**: Mosaic plots and heatmaps using contrasting colors for clarity.

### 4. Age and Thrombosis
- **Insight**: Patients aged 18â€“29 were admitted most frequently, with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and Lupus being prevalent diagnoses. Older patients (70+) had fewer hospital visits.
- **Visualization**: Age-grouped heatmaps and line plots emphasizing trends over time.

## Visual Storytelling and Themes

### Consistent Themes
- A **custom color palette** was used across all visualizations to ensure a cohesive narrative:
  - Blue hues for "No Thrombosis."
  - Red hues for "Presence of Thrombosis."
  - Gender-based colors for male and female distributions.
- A **uniform style** was applied to titles, labels, and legends to maintain visual consistency.

### Visualization Techniques
- Heatmaps and mosaic plots were used for correlation and dependency analysis.
- Bar charts and count plots provided clear distribution insights.
- Line plots captured trends in hospital visits and patient demographics over time.

### Accessibility
- High-contrast colors and clear fonts ensured readability.
- Consistent use of gridlines and spacing enhanced data clarity.
